      <h2>Course Description</h2>
      <p>
        This lecture-based course comprises four modules that present
        both theory and practice of mobile robot algorithms. These
        modules will be associated with three assignments and one
        project through which students will build a autonomy software
        package. In the first lab, we will add vehicle dynamics
        simulation and linear control capabilities.  The second
        assignment aims at adding mapping and state estimation
        capability. The third assignment will enable students to add
        motion planners. The project combines the
        capabilities from the three modules into an individual
	student project that leverages the software system developed
	through the prior assignments.
      </p>

      <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
      <p>
        When you complete this course, you will be able to:
        <ul>
            <li>Aerial Robot Autonomy: Implement a framework for autonomous quadrotor navigation.</li>
            <li>Development Skills: Plan software development efforts that address robotics applications.</li>
            <li>Software Artifacts: Develop a nontrivial mobile robot application.</li>
            <li>Algorithmic Familiarity: Implement key probabilisitc algorithms in mobile robotics.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
      <p>
        Undergraduate-level understanding of probability, statistics,
        and algorithms is assumed. Experience with Python and basic
        familiarity with linear algebra, probability theory, and
        ordinary differential equations will benefit the student
        throughout the semester.
      </p>

      <h2>Learning Resources</h2>
      <p>
    There is no textbook required for this course. Slides and
    additional references for further reading will be provided with
    each lecture on the course website.
      </p>

    <h2>Assessments</h2>
      <p>
    This course implements software for mobile
    robots. Consequently, the assessments depend heavily on
    programming. We will be using the Python and C++ programming
    languages throughout the course. Your final grade in this
    course will be assessed according to:
      </p>
    <ul>
        <li>75% Homework</li>
        <li>25% Project</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Homework</h2>
    <p>
    Three mandatory assignments will be provided during the semester. Students will have at least
    two weeks to complete each assignment. All homework will be distributed using
    GitHub and collected using AutoLab. AutoLab will enable auto-grading and feedback
    for students to help them finalize submissions. Solutions and grades will be returned within
    one week of homework due dates.
    </p>

    <h2>Office Hours</h2>
    <p>
    Office hours will be held twice each week from 1700-1800ET on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of office hours, Piazza will be used for all
      communication.  Use public posts to ask questions that you would
      like answered by Wennie or your classmates.  Use public
      posts to share any course related content with the instructor
      and your classmates.  Post privately if you have specific
      questions regarding your performance on homeworks, the course,
      or anyting else. If these private posts are not answered within
      24 hours, please email Wennie with the subject line starting
      with [16-362 Student].
