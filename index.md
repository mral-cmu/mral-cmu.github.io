# Welcome to 16-362: Mobile Robot Algorithms Laboratory

Hello students and visitors! This is the official webpage for
**16-362: Mobile Robot Algorithms Laboratory**.

- **Class Dates and Times**: Tuesdays and Thursdays 0930-1050 ET in NSH 3002
- **Instructor**: Wennie Tabib
- **Office**: LL 05, Building Collaborative Innovation Commons
- **Contact**: wtabib (at) cmu.edu

This lecture-based course comprises four modules that present both
theory and practice of mobile robot algorithms. These modules will be
associated with three assignments and a project through which students
will build a autonomy software package. In assignment 1, we will write
a vehicle dynamics simulation and develop linear control capabilities.
Assignment 2 aims at adding mapping and state estimation
capability. Assignment 3 will enable students to add motion planners.
The project combines the capabilities from the three modules into an
individual student project that may leverage the software system
developed through the prior assignments.

# Learning Objectives
When you complete this course, you will be able to:
* Aerial Robot Autonomy: Implement a framework for autonomous quadrotor navigation and exploration.
* Development Skills: Plan software development efforts that address robotics applications.
* Software Artifacts: Develop a nontrivial mobile robot application.
* Algorithmic Familiarity: Implement key probabilisitc algorithms in mobile robotics.

# Pre-requisites
Undergraduate-level understanding of probability, statistics, and
algorithms is assumed. Experience with Python and basic familiarity
with linear algebra, probability theory, and ordinary differential
equations will benefit the student throughout the semester.

# Learning Resources
There is no textbook required for this course. Slides and additional
references for further reading will be provided with each lecture on
the course website.

# Assessments
This course implements software for mobile robots. Consequently, the
assessments depend heavily on programming. We will be using the Python
programming languages throughout the course. Your final grade in this
course will be assessed according to:

* 75% Homework
  * assignment1: 25% (Transforms, Quadrotor Dynamics, and Control)
  * assignment2: 25% (Mapping and State Estimation)
  * assignment3: 25% (Quadrotor Planning)
* 25% Project
  * 10%: form groups of 2-3 and present your project proposal on Oct. 23 or Oct. 30
    * The project proposal presentations should include:
  	  * Motivation
	  * Related work
	  * Approach you will implement
	  * How you will evaluate your approach
	  * Timeline
	  * Anticipated results
  * 15%: final project presentation (Dec. 2, Dec. 4)

# Homework and Late Day Policy
Three mandatory assignments will be provided during the semester. All
homework will be distributed using GitHub and collected using
AutoLab. AutoLab will enable auto-grading and feedback for students to
help them finalize submissions. Grades are available a few minutes after
uploading the assignment. You may submit as many times as you'd like (i.e.,
unlimited number of submissions are allowed).

You will have 12 late days that you may use throughout the semester.
You can use them all on one assignment or spread them out over
multiple assignments. Leftover late days will be converted to extra
credit at a value of 0.5% per remaining late day (maximum extra credit
for 12 late days is 6%). If you use all your late days, and submit
late you will be penalized by 25 points per day. Each assignment is
worth 100 points so this means using all your late days and submitting
two days late will result in a maximum score of 50 points (or 50%).

This late day policy exists to help students avoid potential
situations where multiple complex assignments from different classes
are all due at approximately the same time.

# Project
Students will be required to work together in teams of 2-3 to complete
a group project. The project will be worth 25% of the final grade.
10% of that grade will come from group formation and presenting a
project proposal. The remaining 15% will come from the final project
presentation, which is scheduled on the last 2 days of class.  **Late
days may not be used on the project.**
